"""
Multi-Signal Confidence Scorer
================================
Combines multiple RLM signals into an overall confidence score and tier classification.

Tiers:
- TIER 1: 85%+ confidence → Full position
- TIER 2: 75%+ confidence → Partial position  
- LEAN: 60%+ confidence → Small position or watch
- PASS: <60% confidence → No bet
